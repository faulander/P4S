> Premieres for Sonarr - a small sonarr companion app to find all the new shows you've never been interested in!


P4S is a app that updates it's local database with the show information from TV Maze. You can then search for shows and conveniently adding them to Sonarr. The difference between Sonarr's own search is, that you can filter by language, premiere date, etc.
